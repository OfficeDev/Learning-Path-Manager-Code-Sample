#Learning Path Manager - Code Sample

This sample, by [Andrew Connell](http://www.andrewconnell.com) ([@andrewconnell](http://www.twitter.com/andrewconnell)), was used [Jeremy Thake's](http://www.jeremythake.com) session at [TechEd North America 2014](http://northamerica.msteched.com/), session [DEV-B229 - Deep Dive into Developing Advanced Microsoft SharePoint Applications Using Third-Party JavaScript Libraries](http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/NorthAmerica/2014/DEV-B229#fbid=AN8G_AhS5Fi).

The sample demonstrates a SharePoit-Hosted App implemented using the single page app (SPA) pattern. It leverages the popular AnguarJS presentation framework for SPA's and utilizes the SharePoint 2013 REST API and client side object model (CSOM).

##For More Details, See Andrew's Course on SharePoint Apps as SPAs
This demo application is part of a 6-module, 3.5 hour course [Andrew Connell](http://www.andrewconnell.com) published on **[Building SharePoint Apps as Single Page Apps with AnguarJS](http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/building-sharepoint-apps-spa-angularjs)** in the [Pluralsight](http://www.pluralsight.com) catalog. The course walks you through creating your first SharePoint-Hosted App as a SPA using AngularJS while leveraging SharePoint 2013 lists to store the data used by the application. In addition, the course has an extra module (#5) that demonstrates how to leverage the popular [BreezeJS](http://www.breezejs.com) client-side library to implement change tracking, client caching, rich queries... sort of like Microsoft's Entity Framework ORM but in the client!
